 *      chunks owned.
 *      - the uncrypted public chunk where everyone find the user's public
 *      profile containing information such as name, sirname...
 *      - the asimetrically crypted protected chunk where the user have the
 *      private key stored in the private chunk. Therefore only the user can

 *      key is stored in the user's public chunk, and everyone can ONLY append
 *      some crypted data.
